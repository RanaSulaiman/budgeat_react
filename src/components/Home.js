      The available data indicates that the great majority of low-income Americans not only understand the importance of healthy eating but also they want to know more about how to do so. The biggest barriers are cost and time.

       <strong>BudgEat </strong>is my capstone project for Ada Developers Academy, Cohort 7. Users of <strong>BudgEat </strong> not only have access to a variety of healthy, inexpensive, and easy to make recipes with cooking time and cost per serving accessible, they can search recipes by dish type, and food intolerances.
    </p>

    <p className='text-justify'>
      Price per serving is an estimated price based on average costs. Since grocery prices do range  from region to region and store to store.
